["Paramore", "Still into You", "Paroles de la chanson Still Into You par Paramore\r\nCan't count the years one hand\nThat we've been together\nI need the other one to hold you.\nMake you feel, make you feel better.\nIt's not a walk in the park\nTo love each other.\nBut when our fingers interlock,\nCan't deny, can't deny you're worth it\n\nCause after all this time.\nI'm still into you\n\nI should be over all the butterflies\nBut i'm into you (I'm in to you)\nAnd baby even on our worst nights\nI'm into you (I'm into you)\n\nLet em wonder how we got this far\nCause I don't really need to wonder at all\nYeah after all this time\nI'm still into you\n\nRecount the night that I first\nMet your mother\nAnd on the drive back to my house\nI told you that, I told you that I loved ya.\nYou felt the weight of the world\nFall off your shoulder\nAnd to your favorite song\nWe sang along to the start of forever\n\nAnd after all this time.\nI'm still into you\n\nI should be over all the butterflies\n\nBut i'm into you (I'm in to you)\nAnd baby even on our worst nights\nI'm into you (I'm into you)\nLet em wonder how we got this far\nCause I don't really need to wonder at all\nYeah after all this time\nI'm still into you\n\nSome things just,\nSome things just make sense\nAnd one of those is you and I\nSome things just,\nSome things just make sense\nAnd even after all this time\nI'm into You\nBaby not a day goes by that\nI'm not into you\n\n\nI should be over all the butterflies\nBut i'm into you (I'm in to you)\nAnd baby even on our worst nights\nI'm into you (I'm into you)\nLet em wonder how we got this far\nCause I don't really need to wonder at all\nYeah after all this time\nI'm still into you\nI'm still into you\nI'm still into you"]
