["Harry Styles", "Kiwi", "Paroles de la chanson Kiwi par Harry Styles\r\nShe worked her way through a cheap pack of cigarettes\nHard liquor mixed with a bit of intellect\nAnd all the boys, they were saying they were into it\nSuch a pretty face, on a pretty neck\n\nShe's driving me crazy, but I'm into it, but I'm into it\nI'm kinda into it\nIt's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it, I think I'm losing it\nOh, I think she said \"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business\"\n\"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business\"\n\n\"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business\"\n\"I'm having your baby, it's none of your, it's none of your\"\n\nIt's New York, baby, always jacked up\nHolland Tunnel for a nose, it's always backed up [sniffing]\nWhen she's alone, she goes home to a cactus\nIn a black dress, she's such an actress\n\nDriving me crazy, but I'm into it, but I'm into it\nI'm kinda into it\nIt's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it, I think I'm losing it\nOh, I think she said \"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business\"\n\n\"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business\" (it's none of your, it's none of your)\n\"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business\"\n\"I'm having your baby, it's none of your, it's none of your\"\n\nShe sits beside me like a silhouette\nHard candy dripping on me 'til my feet are wet\nAnd now she's all over me, it's like I paid for it (cha-ching!)\nIt's like I paid for it, I'm gonna pay for this\n\nIt's none of your, it's none of your\n\"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business\"\n\"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business\" (it's none of your, none of your)\n\n\"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business\"\n\"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business\" (it's none of your, none of your)"]
